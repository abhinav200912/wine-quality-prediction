For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:-

1.Fixed acidity 

2.Volatile acidity 

3.Citric acid

4.Residual sugar

5.Chlorides

6.Free sulfur dioxide 

7.Total sulfur dioxide 

8.Density 

9.pH 

10.Sulfates

11.Alcohol


Objectives:-

The objectives of this project are as follows:-

To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy.

To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine.


By looking into the details, we can see that good quality wines have higher levels of alcohol on average, have a lower volatile acidity on average, higher levels of sulphates on average, and higher levels of residual sugar on average.
